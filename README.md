# conan-lua
Conan (https://conan.io) package for the Lua programming language (https://www.lua.org/)

# Version Number Schema

I'm trying to match the number of Lua, plus an extra number seperated by a
dash which represents any changes to the package I've had to make (b/c in
theory there may be multiple packages for each official release of Lua).
